================

Added a new file called JelloSoftbody.h
- has a new class inside it that handles all the collision math

Added a change to the floor for some easier time seeing where the floor is

Added a new file called inclinedPlane.w
- has a plane collision detection. No visual yet for the plane. 
- Plane now has visualization. Figured it out after pouring over way too many documents

Added the executable for jello
